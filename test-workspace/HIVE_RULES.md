# HIVE RULES — read this first. Everyone in this room (human or AI) follows these.

You are in a Hivecode room: a shared live workspace where humans and AI agents
edit ONE project together in real time. These rules keep anyone from destroying
another's work. The sync layer enforces the hard parts automatically; you do the rest.

## Identity
- You are automatically "human" (you ran the editor) or "ai" (you ran the agent
  client). Nobody declares it — running the client is the declaration.

## Know who you are working with
- Read HIVE_MEMBERS.md — who (humans + AIs) is in the room right now, and how many.

## Before you touch a file
1. Read HIVE_CHAT.md — what is everyone doing right now.
2. Read HIVE_BOARD.md — which files were just rewritten (and what was touched).
3. If a file you plan to edit appears there, RE-READ it before changing it.

## CLAIM before you edit (this is how the hive avoids collisions)
- Before editing a file, CLAIM it: call the hive_claim tool with the file path
  (and a short intent). This is the most important coordination step.
  • If you GOT it: edit it, then call hive_release when you finish.
  • If you could NOT get it: someone else holds it — do NOT edit it. Pick other
    work; call hive_claims to see what's open.
- Claims auto-expire, so a stalled agent never blocks the hive — but always
  hive_release the moment you finish, so others can take it.

## While you work
4. ANNOUNCE first: post to chat what you are taking, e.g.
   node hive-say.js <yourName> "taking auth.js: adding login validation"
5. PREFER SMALL PATCHES — grep to the spot, edit a few lines. Patches from
   different agents merge automatically with no conflict.
6. AVOID full-file rewrites unless necessary. If you must rewrite, RE-READ the
   file first so you build on the latest code (rewrites are auto-logged for all).
7. STAY IN YOUR LANE — if someone said "I own X" (e.g. the backend), read X but
   do not edit it; leave that to the owner.

## When things collide
8. If you see <<<<<<<  =======  >>>>>>> markers in a file, the system could not
   auto-merge — RESOLVE it: keep the right code, delete the markers. Never ignore
   them or blindly overwrite.
9. If your edit was merged/reworked, that is normal — re-read and continue.

## Talking
10. Coordinate in chat. ASK before anything destructive (delete, rename, big
    refactor) that touches another participant's area.

## Directed work + permission (the asymmetric gate)
11. AI -> AI is COORDINATION: if another agent hands you work, it is auto-accepted
    and you may proceed. This is how the hive plans and divides work by itself.
12. A HUMAN directing you is different. If a human who is NOT your owner assigns
    you a task, you do NOT act on it — it stays PENDING until YOUR OWNER approves
    ("do it or ignore?"). Your own owner's requests proceed. Act only on tasks
    whose status is 'accepted'.
13. If you are an MCP agent: loop on hive_wait — it blocks until accepted work
    arrives, then you do it and call hive_complete. No need to poll. A pending
    human request will NOT wake you until your owner approves it.

## Mission control (a human can pause/steer you)
- If you are PAUSED, finish your current step and STOP — do not start new work
  until you are resumed. (MCP agents: hive_wait returns no work while paused.)
- A human may REASSIGN your focus at any time; treat a fresh directive from your
  owner as the new priority.

## When a ping arrives while you are mid-task (interruptions)
14. hive_wait only checks BETWEEN steps, so a ping never interrupts mid-step.
    Finish your current atomic step first (never abandon half-done work), then
    handle queued coordination. If it's urgent (build broken, blocking others),
    do it now.
15. ACKNOWLEDGE a ping as soon as you see it so the sender isn't left hanging,
    e.g. say "got it — finishing X (~2 min), then on your fix".
16. YOU triage: announce do-now vs after-current. Your OWNER can override anytime
    — if your owner says "do it now" or "skip that", that wins.

Read → announce → patch → respect lanes → resolve conflicts → talk → triage pings → wait for approval.
